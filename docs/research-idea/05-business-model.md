# SheraTutor — Business Model

## The Core Structure: Free-for-Students, Paid-by-Institutions

This is a deliberate two-sided model, not a freemium funnel:

- **B2C (students): 100% free, permanently.** No tiered "premium" grading, no ad monetization targeting students, no data-selling. This is the mission, not a loss-leader with strings attached.
- **B2B (institutions): the entire revenue engine.** Schools, coaching centers, and government bodies pay for the infrastructure that makes free grading possible at scale.

### Why this works financially

The B2C side is expensive to run (inference costs, curriculum maintenance, support) but **generates the data, credibility, and usage volume** that makes the B2B product valuable and sellable. The B2B side is what actually needs to fund it — and unlike students, institutions have budgets already allocated to the exact problems SheraTutor solves (they currently pay teachers' overtime for manual grading, pay printers/vendors for question papers, and have no systematic way to track cohort-wide weak points).

## B2B Revenue Streams (detail)

| Stream | Description | Target buyer |
|---|---|---|
| **Question paper generation** | Subscription or per-batch fee for AI-generated, board-standard MCQ/CQ question sets, calibrated to syllabus and difficulty. | Schools, coaching centers |
| **Answer script evaluation (per-script or per-batch pricing)** | Institutions send scanned/photographed scripts from their own exams; SheraTutor returns graded scores + mark breakdowns at a fraction of the cost of hiring extra grading staff. | Schools, coaching centers |
| **Explanation & deduction reporting** | Detailed "why this mark was lost" reports per student, usable in parent-teacher conferences — a premium add-on to raw grading. | Schools, coaching centers |
| **Cohort/institutional analytics dashboard** | Ongoing subscription for school- or center-wide performance tracking, weak-chapter heatmaps, and benchmarking. | Schools, coaching centers, government |
| **Government/board partnerships** | Larger-scale contracts for standardized assessment support, national curriculum weak-point analytics, or pilot integration into board-level testing infrastructure. | Ministry of Education, education boards |
| **White-label licensing** | Coaching centers brand the grading tool as their own value-add to differentiate from competitors. | Coaching centers |

## Go-to-Market Sequencing

1. **Coaching centers first** — fastest to close, most price-sensitive to labor savings, and the best environment to calibrate grading against real, messy handwriting at manageable scale.
2. **Schools next** — once grading accuracy and case studies exist from the coaching center pilots, schools are a natural expansion with a longer but more defensible sales cycle.
3. **Government last (but highest ceiling)** — approached once there's a credible track record (accuracy data, adoption numbers, testimonials) to support a national-level conversation.

## B2C Pre-Launch: The Waitlist

Before the product is fully built, Phase 1 runs a **dedicated B2C digital marketing push** — social media ads, coaching-center and campus outreach, and content aimed directly at SSC/HSC students — driving to a **waitlist landing page** rather than a live product.

This does three things at once:
- **Validates real demand** before engineering time is spent at scale — sign-up numbers and campaign response rates become an early, honest signal of whether "free AI grading" actually resonates with students, not just with investors.
- **Builds a ready-made launch audience** — the web/mobile beta in Phase 3–4 launches to a warm list instead of starting from zero.
- **Gives investors traction to point to** — a waitlist number alongside the market-size data (see `02-market-analysis.md`) turns "here's the opportunity" into "here's early evidence people want this," which is a meaningfully stronger pitch position.

This is a B2C-only motion — it runs in parallel with, not instead of, the B2B sequencing above, since the two audiences are acquired through completely different channels (consumer ads and organic/social for students; direct outreach and pilots for institutions).

## The Ask (Seed Round)

Raising a seed round to fund Phases 1–3: curriculum/RAG buildout (digitizing NCTB textbooks and past board papers), cloud/API/infrastructure costs (vision/OCR usage, Supabase hosting, n8n workflow infra through beta), and the B2B pilot/sales motion (outbound to coaching centers, onboarding, first white-label pilots).

Round size and terms to be confirmed with lead investor — not yet fixed.
